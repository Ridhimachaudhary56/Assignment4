        "# **Python OOPs Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans1:- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans2:- In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables. The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans3:- An object is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program. Objects are the basic units of object-oriented programming. A simple example of an object would be a person. Logically, you would expect a person to have a name\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans4:- Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods within a single unit, like a class, and controlling their access, whereas abstraction is about hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential functionalities\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans5:- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that have double underscores (or “dunders”) at the beginning and end of their names. These methods provide a way to define specific behaviors for built-in operations or functionalities in Python classes\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans6:- In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It is a fundamental concept in OOP that promotes code reuse and establishes relationships between classes\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans7:- Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. Polymorphism in programming gives a program the ability to redefine methods for derived classes\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans8:- Encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class's data members and methods as either private or protected. But in Python, we do not have keywords like public, private, and protected, as in the case of Java. Instead, we achieve this by using single and double underscores\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans9:- Constructors in Python is a special class method for creating and initializing an object instance at that class. Every Python class has a constructor; it's not required to be defined explicitly. The purpose of the constructor is to construct an object and assign a value to the object's members\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans10:- A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters. A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans11:- Two or more methods have the same name but different numbers of parameters or different types of parameters, or both. These methods are called overloaded methods and this is called method overloading\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans12:- Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans13:- A decorator feature in Python wraps in a function, appends several functionalities to existing code and then returns it. Methods and functions are known to be callable as they can be called. Therefore, a decorator is also a callable that returns callable. This is also known as metaprogramming as at compile time a section of program alters another section of the program. Note: For more information, refer to Decorators in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans14:- This concept is significant because it promotes code reusability, reduces redundancy, and facilitates the creation of a hierarchy among classes. Inheritance enables the formation of parent-child relationships, allowing child classes to extend or override the behavior of their parent classes\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans15:- In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes allow us to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface while still allowing the subclasses to provide specific implementations\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans16:- Advantages-\n",
        "We can build the programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another, rather than having to start writing the code from scratch which leads to saving of development time and higher productivity,\n",
        "OOP language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easily (one object at a time).\n",
        "The new technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance cost.\n",
        "OOP systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems.\n",
        "It is possible that multiple instances of objects co-exist without any interference,\n",
        "It is very easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.\n",
        "It is possible to map the objects in problem domain to those in the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages-\n",
        "The length of the programmes developed using OOP language is much larger than the procedural approach. Since the programme becomes larger in size, it requires more time to be executed that leads to slower execution of the programme.\n",
        "We can not apply OOP everywhere as it is not a universal language. It is applied only when it is required.  It is not suitable for all types of problems.\n",
        "Programmers need to have brilliant designing skill and programming skill along with proper planning because using OOP is little bit tricky.\n",
        "OOPs take time to get used to it.  The thought process involved in object-oriented programming may not be natural for some people.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans17:- Class variables are defined within the class but outside of any class methods. Instance variables are defined within class methods, typically the constructor. Changes made to the class variable affect all instances. Changes made to the instance variable does not affect all instances\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans18:- If a child class is inheriting the properties of a single other class, we call it single inheritance. However, if a child class inherits from more than one class, i.e. this child class is derived from multiple classes, we call it multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans19:- Understanding the __repr__() Method\n",
        "The __repr__() method is used to create a string representation of an object that is more detailed and unambiguous. This method is intended for developers and is used when repr() function is called, or when the object is inspected in the interactive interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the __str__() Method\n",
        "The __str__() method in Python is used to create a string representation of an object that is readable and user-friendly. This method is invoked when str() or print() functions are called on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans20:- In Python, super() is a built-in function that allows access to methods and properties of a parent or superclass from a child or subclass. This is useful when working with inheritance in object-oriented programming\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans21:- __del__ is a finalizer. It is called when an object is garbage collected which happens at some point after all references to the object have been deleted. In a simple case this could be right after you say del x or, if x is a local variable, after the function ends\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans22:- The Difference between Class Method and Static method is stated below. While a static method requires no specific parameters, a class method takes cls as its first argument. While a static method cannot access or modify the class state, a class method can. Static methods are typically unaware of the class state\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans23:- Polymorphism, a child class method is allowed to have the same name as the class methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the methods belonging to the parent class are passed down to the child class. It's also possible to change a method that a child class has inherited from its parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans24:- Method chaining refers to calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a single expression. Each method call returns an object, often the same object (modified or not), allowing the subsequent method to operate on that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans25:- __call__() is to turn your instances into callable objects. In other words, its purpose is to create objects that you can call as you would call a regular function. Most Python classes don't implement this method. Your custom classes will have it only if you need to use your instances as functions"
